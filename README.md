## Hi there 👋

<h3>About:</h3>
<p>Hello, I'm Dwi putra widiono, a eighth-semester student at BINUS University. Now I'm focusing on mobile app development and website development, particularly using Kotlin and Flutter for mobile development and for website development using Angular. I have a strong passion for learning and constantly expanding my skill set. In addition to mobile development, I’m exploring other fields like UI/UX design in Figma and game development in Unity. I'm always open to collaboration and new challenges that help me grow as a developer and designer. Recently, I’ve also been diving deeper into frontend development using React JS, working with web technologies like HTML, CSS, and Typescript, aiming to create seamless and visually appealing user experiences. </p>
